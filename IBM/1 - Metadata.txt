This directory has a 'simple' model of the IBM
The complex model includes a lot more parameters
After first analyses, different parameters were taken fixed --> this is the 'simple' model

Hist_distances.txt, suitabilityINLAv2.jpg --> input for Bembix_model_simple.py

Bembix_*_s.py --> loops for all scenarios to make several runs for a scenario (input: begin number, end number e.g. 0 1000--> makes 1000 runs)

Bembix_model_simple.py --> actual IBM, used by all Bembix_*_s.py

Note: some names of scenarios were changed while writing the manuscript and so are not consistent between the scripts and manuscript: 'bimodal' became 'individual flexibility IF', 'CF' became 'Producers Scroungers PS', 'PEBU' became 'Local site fidelity LSF'.
