source code and data for manuscript

## Microhabitat model
- 'Microhabitat Final Model with iterations.R': source code for the microhabitat model with INLA, including 10 iterations for cross-validation.
- 'Microhabitat Final Model visualisations of iterations.R': source code for making graphs of the microhabitat model. Datafiles needed in this script are made by 'Microhabitat Final Model with iterations.R' or given.
- MicrohabitatmodelComplete.xlsx: datafile needed
- RegPoints.txt

Note: a selection of 'real nests' are made within the scripts, these are nests that have multiple visits on several days, where prey were brought to, or where prolonged digging was seen. This species is known for doing test diggings, and we wanted to exclude these from the analyses.
